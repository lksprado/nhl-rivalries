# GAME DAY RIVALRY WARNING

The objective of this project is to receive an email on the days of NHL regular-season games that involve at least one of the top 50 rivalries of the past 25 years. Rivalries are defined based on the number of fights involving the teams, with data scraped from hockeyfights.com obtained from a separate project. The regular season starts in October, and a DAG will scan the game schedule and the top 50 rivalries spreadsheet. In case of a match, an email will be sent containing details of the games and their timings.
